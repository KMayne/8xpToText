TI-83+ 8xp to text converter
============================

A small utility for converting 8xp files from the TI-83+ series of calculators to text.
This utility interprets the binary data in the 8xp files and produces a human-readable text file, attempting to replicate the display of the calculator.

### Usage
8xpToText file1.8xp file2.8xp ...

Run the program with the desired 8xp files as arguments. The utility will then output PROGNAME.txt for each file, where PROGNAME is that of the program on the calculator embedded in the file.

If you don't really know what you're doing, copy and paste the .8xp files to the folder with 8xpToText in it. Then drag the files one by one onto 8xpToText.
